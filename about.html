                When I looked at world of software development from other angle I realized I can influence it a lot by creating user experience
                and UI design. Moreover I'm passioned about software that has intuitive(simple) user experience and clear
                visualization. I'm a person with active lifestyle, travel is a important part of my life and I like to challenge
                myself to grove in different fields and evolve like design does. Also it worse to mention that I was not
                afraid to start education of new field from zero. That being said I sat my foals to become highly skilled
                user experience designer.</p>
